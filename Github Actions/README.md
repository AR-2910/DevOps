# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful and flexible automation platform provided by GitHub, enabling developers to automate workflows directly within their repositories. It facilitates continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), and various other automation tasks, all integrated seamlessly with the GitHub ecosystem.

GitHub Actions allows users to define custom workflows in YAML files stored within their repositories. These workflows can be triggered by various events, such as pushes, pull requests, issue comments, and more. Workflows are composed of one or more jobs, each containing a series of steps to be executed on different runners.

## Projects

1. **Python Github Hosted Pipeline**: A workflow to automate the testing process for a Python application. It checks out the code, sets up the Python environment, installs dependencies, and runs tests using pytest.
2. **Docker Self Hosted Pipeline**: A workflow to automate Dockerized app deployment using GitHub Actions with self-hosted runners. Checkout code, build Docker image and push Docker image to Docker Hub.

## Advantages of GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions offers numerous advantages over traditional automation platforms, including:

- **Native Integration with GitHub**: GitHub Actions is tightly integrated with GitHub repositories, enabling seamless automation directly within the development workflow.

- **Simplified Configuration**: Workflows are defined using YAML syntax directly within the repository, providing a straightforward and version-controlled approach to automation.

- **Scalability**: GitHub Actions provides scalable infrastructure for executing workflows, ensuring reliable performance even for large projects.

- **Flexibility**: With a wide range of actions and community-contributed workflows available in the GitHub Marketplace, users can easily customize and extend their automation pipelines to suit their specific needs.

- **Cost-Effective**: GitHub Actions offers generous free usage limits for public repositories and affordable pricing plans for private repositories, making it a cost-effective choice for both open-source and commercial projects.

- **Community Support**: With a large and active community of users and contributors, GitHub Actions benefits from continuous improvement and support from the community.

These advantages make GitHub Actions a powerful and flexible automation platform suitable for a wide range of use cases, from simple CI/CD pipelines to complex workflows involving multiple stages and environments.

## GitHub vs Self-Hosted Runners

- **GitHub Hosted Runners**: These runners are maintained by GitHub and come pre-configured with various software environments, eliminating the need for manual setup. They are suitable for most use cases but may have limited resources and longer queue times during peak usage.

- **Self-Hosted Runners**: Users can set up their own runners on their infrastructure, providing more control over the execution environment and potentially faster execution times. This option is ideal for projects with specific requirements or resource-intensive workflows.
