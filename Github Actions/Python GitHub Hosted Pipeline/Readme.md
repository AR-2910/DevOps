# Project Name: Python GitHub Hosted Pipeline

### Description

This GitHub Actions Pipeline project automates the testing process for Python projects. It showcases the seamless integration of GitHub Actions into a software development workflow, ensuring code reliability and correctness.

### What It Does

The workflow automates the testing process for Python projects using GitHub Actions. It executes a set of predefined tests upon each push event in the repository, validating the functionality and correctness of the codebase.

### GitHub Hosted Execution

Utilizing GitHub Actions, the project automates the testing process without the need for manual intervention. Upon each push event in the repository, GitHub Actions triggers the configured workflow, running tests on various versions of Python to ensure compatibility and reliability.

### Benefits

- **Automation**: GitHub Actions automates the testing process, saving time and effort by eliminating the need for manual testing.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integration with GitHub Actions enables continuous integration, maintaining code quality and reliability with ease.
- **Efficiency**: By seamlessly integrating testing into the development workflow, GitHub Actions enhances workflow efficiency and ensures code correctness.
- **Scalability**: GitHub Actions scales effortlessly to handle various projects and workflows, accommodating the needs of diverse development teams.

### How to Use

1. **Locate Project Directory and Create Workflow**:

    Navigate to the project directory on your local machine where you want to set up the GitHub Actions workflow. Once in the project directory, navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository on the GitHub website. From there, you can create a new workflow file by selecting the appropriate option.

2. **Explore GitHub Actions Workflow**:

    Review and customize the `.github/workflows` directory, specifically the workflow file, to fit your project requirements.

3. **Trigger GitHub Actions Workflow**:

    Make changes to the codebase and push them to the repository. GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the configured workflow, executing tests and providing feedback on code correctness and reliability.
