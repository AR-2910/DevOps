# Jenkins 

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an open-source automation server widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. It provides a powerful platform for automating various tasks related to building, testing, and deploying software applications.

## Projects:

1. Python Multi-Stage Pipeline: A pipeline based on multi-stage workflow to check Python and Pip versions on an AWS EC2 instance using Docker containers.

## Advantages of Jenkins

- **Flexibility**: Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins and integrations, allowing users to customize and extend its functionality to suit their specific needs.
- **Scalability**: Jenkins can scale to handle large and complex build pipelines, making it suitable for projects of any size.
- **Community Support**: With a large and active community of users and contributors, Jenkins benefits from continuous improvement and support from the community.
- **Integration**: Jenkins integrates seamlessly with other tools and services commonly used in software development workflows, such as version control systems, issue trackers, and deployment platforms.

## How to Run Jenkins

### Cloud-Based Execution

You can deploy Jenkins on cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure. Cloud-based deployment offers scalability, reliability, and accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection.

### Localhost Execution

Alternatively, you can run Jenkins on your local machine using Docker. Simply pull the Jenkins Docker image from Docker Hub and run it. Once Jenkins is running, you can access the Jenkins dashboard by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## Docker Agent Usage in Pipelines

Jenkins pipelines can utilize Docker containers as build agents to ensure consistent and isolated environments for each pipeline run. Docker agents provide benefits such as reproducibility, scalability, and resource efficiency. At the end of each pipeline run, the Docker container used as the build agent is automatically terminated, ensuring clean-up and resource optimization.
